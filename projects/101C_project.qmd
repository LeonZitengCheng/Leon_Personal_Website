## Regression Modeling of Amazon Order Totals

-   Built supervised learning models to predict log-total Amazon order amounts using a dataset of \~5,000 customers across states and months.

-   Performed extensive feature engineering, preprocessing, and EDA (8+ visualizations) to handle categorical variables, missing data, and seasonality.

-   Compared and tuned 5+ regression algorithms (linear regression, random forest, XGBoost, etc.) with v-fold cross-validation, selecting the best model based on RMSE.

-   Produced a fully reproducible R pipeline with annotated scripts and a technical report detailing diagnostics, limitations, and potential improvements.
