## Federated Lasso Regression with Coordinate Descent

-   Implemented from scratch a coordinate descent algorithm for Lasso regression in R, including custom soft-thresholding and convergence criteria.

-   Tuned the regularization parameter λ via validation loss across three independent datasets (600 predictors each); reported non-zero coefficient indices and test loss for each model.

-   Designed a federated learning framework where three data owners iteratively performed local Lasso updates and shared only model coefficients with a trusted aggregator, ensuring data privacy.
