## Savills Commercial Real Estate Market Analysis

-   Built a multiple linear regression model to quantify the impact of economic indicators and lease characteristics on market growth and leasing activity.

-   Incorporated qualitative insights (e.g., political, social factors) to complement the quantitative model and propose actionable recommendations to maximize return on investment.

-   Delivered data-driven strategic guidance to Savills on high-opportunity regions despite limitations in post-project impact assessment due to competition constraints.
