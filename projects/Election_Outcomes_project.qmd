-   Developed models to classify the 2020 U.S. presidential winner (Biden vs. Trump) for 3,111 counties using demographic and education predictors.

-   Engineered features, explored interactions, and implemented data preprocessing tailored to highly imbalanced classes.Built supervised learning models to predict log-total Amazon order amounts using a dataset of \~5,000 customers across states and months.

-   Evaluated and tuned multiple classification methods (logistic regression, random forest, SVM, XGBoost, neural networks) using cross-validation, achieving high Accuracy/AUC on the private Kaggle leaderboard.

-   Delivered a reproducible R workflow and concise technical report summarizing methodology, model comparison, and practical insights.
