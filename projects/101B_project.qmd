## **Memory Study** **— Experimental Design and ANOVA Analysis**

- Designed and conducted a **2×3 factorial experiment** to study how **beverage temperature** (cold milk, warm milk, hot tea) and **emotional state** (happy, neutral, sad) affect short-term memory performance.

- Implemented a **Python-based random sampling scheme** and determined required sample size (power = 0.8, α = 0.05, effect size = 0.25) using **G\*Power.**

- Collected and analyzed data from 261 participants; applied **two-way ANOVA** and **Tukey HSD post-hoc tests** in R to assess main and interaction effects.

- Verified model assumptions via **residual and Q–Q plots**; interpreted that **emotional state had a statistically significant but distributed effect** on memory performance
